# Startup Scripts
Although I have common options for all my computers, I have some different options as well. For example, I don't need the options for steam on my web server. These uncommon options are saved in 'pieces'

# Pieces
Pieces are broken up into login and non_login pieces. This might change though as it seems arbitrarily restrictive.

# Specified configurations
What pieces to use the  for bashrc (interactive non-login shell) and profile (login shell) are saved for each computer in specifed_configurations.
The installer assumes that they are named hostname--Bashrc_Pieces and hostname--Profile_Pieces.

# Current limitations
Git repository must be be in $HOME/git/configuration_files
