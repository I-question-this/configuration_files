The bashrc file contains options for every one of my ubuntu bash set ups.
Other pieces of code are stores in the pieces directory in files named after what they are grouped with.
Pieces are chosen via creating a file that runs them when the bashrc is sourced.
This file showed have a link named '.bash_setting_pieces' in the home directory so that it may be run. Additionlly this git repository must be in /home/$USER/git/configuration_files
